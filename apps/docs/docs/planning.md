# 🧠 2. Project Planning

Planning is the foundation of any successful project.  
Before writing a single line of code, it's important to clearly understand:

- What we’re building
- Who it’s for
- What features it needs
- How it will scale

Diagrams, documents, and planning tools help ensure everyone is on the same page—**technical or not**. That’s exactly what this section is for.

## 🚀 Project Overview: What is WebForge?

**WebForge** is a modern, no-code platform that lets users build, deploy, and manage websites through an intuitive visual interface.

Think: drag-and-drop builder meets developer-grade deployment tools—packaged in a sleek, accessible experience.

### 🌟 Core Features

✅ **Visual Builder**  
Drag-and-drop components like text, images, buttons, containers, and more.  
No code. Just creativity.

✅ **Deploy in One Click**  
Push sites live using built-in hosting integrations—zero config.

✅ **Dashboard**  
Manage all your sites, see statuses, updates, and project details in one clean interface.

## 🧩 Planned Add-ons & Integrations

These additional features will bring WebForge closer to a production-grade platform:

- 🔐 **Authentication**  
  - Sign up, login, and secure project access
  - Optional social auth (GitHub, Google)

- 💳 **Payments** *(Powered by Stripe)*  
  - Monetize publishing or premium features
  - Subscription or pay-per-deploy models

- 📊 **Analytics Integration** *(Google Analytics or Plausible)*  
  - View site traffic, user behavior, and performance

- ☁️ **Hosting Integration** *(Vercel or similar)*  
  - Enable users to publish directly to trusted platforms

## 🔭 Project Goals

1. **Build a usable MVP** with core builder functionality
2. **Deploy backend and frontend** with a monorepo setup
3. **Scale** by layering in integrations like Stripe and Auth
4. **Document everything**—from architecture to user flows

---

## 🗺️ Next Steps

- [ ] Define user personas and use cases
- [ ] Map out system architecture (diagram)
- [ ] Design initial wireframes for builder + dashboard
- [ ] Write feature specs (MVP vs stretch)
