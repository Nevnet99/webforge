## 👤 Who Am I?

> "Build with intention, design with clarity."

👋 Hi, I'm **Luke** — a Web Platform Developer with a passion for **frontend development**, **design systems**, and **accessibility**.

🧭 I started my journey self-taught, then completed a coding bootcamp at **Manchester Codes**. Since then, I’ve worked across agencies, startups, and product-driven teams, creating scalable, high-performance web apps.

---

### 🧰 What I Bring to the Table

- 🏗 **Frontend Expertise**  
  JavaScript, React, Next.js, TypeScript, all the CSS flavors (CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, SCSS), Storybook.

- 🎨 **Design Systems**  
  Built and scaled reusable UI systems that improve developer experience and design consistency.

- 🌍 **Accessibility Advocate**  
  Led improvements in **WCAG compliance** across platforms and workflows.

- 🤝 **Team Player**  
  Comfortable collaborating with cross-functional teams—Design, Product, and Backend engineers.

## 🚀 Why I’m Building WebForge

**WebForge** is a passion project. It’s more than just code—it's my challenge to take an idea and build a **full-stack application from scratch**.

💼 It's also a portfolio piece. It shows I can ship something **real**, **useful**, and **production-ready** on my own.

## 🧭 Before You Dive In

### 💻 IDE: Cursor
I’m using **Cursor** for development.  
While I’m not fully into the “vibe coding” movement, I do think Cursor is a powerful tool **when used properly**.

> It can do about 40% of the work. The rest? That's on me.  
> You just have to know when it’s hallucinating.

### 🗃️ Project Structure: Monorepo
I’m going with a **monorepo** setup to keep both the frontend and backend in one place.

✅ It’s clean and manageable for a solo dev.  
🚫 For team environments, I’d probably go **polyrepo** to avoid scaling issues.

---

### 📜 Git Strategy
I’m aiming to keep the commit history:
- Clean
- Linear
- Easy to follow

So anyone can understand the evolution of the codebase over time.

---

### 📝 Docs & Notes
I’ll be documenting everything along the way using **Docusaurus**.

📚 Docs will live **close to the code** to stay relevant.  
🧠 I’ll use **AI to help polish** my writing.  
👶 Docs are written for a **reading age of 12** to make them as accessible as possible.
