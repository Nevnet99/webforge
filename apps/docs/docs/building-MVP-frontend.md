# 🔧 5. Building the MVP Frontend

## Why I'm Starting with the Frontend

I’ve spent most of my career working in **frontend development**, so it makes sense for me to start there.

Even though I’ll be building the backend later, starting with the frontend helps me figure out how the pages should be structured.  
This will make it easier to design the **JSON data format** the backend will use.

## 🧱 Frontend Stack & Tools

WebForge’s frontend will be built using **Next.js**, which helps make fast, modern websites.

I’ll also be using a **Headless UI library**.  
Right now, I’m choosing between **Radix UI** and **React Aria**.  
Both are great, but I’m leaning toward **React Aria** because it focuses on **accessibility**, which is very important to me.

## 🛠️ Tools I’ll Be Using

Here’s a list of tools and libraries I’ll use to build the frontend:

- **Next.js** – For building fast web apps
- **Tailwind CSS** – For easy and flexible styling
- **React Aria** – For accessible UI components
- **React Hook Form** – For building and managing forms
- **React Query** – For handling API data and state
- **Zustand** – For simple state management

> The goal is to make the frontend clean, fast, and easy to use—for everyone.
